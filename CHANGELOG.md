## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Canonical chat IR in `hofund-ir`: messages, content parts (text, image,
  tool call, tool result, thinking), tool definitions and tool choice,
  generation parameters, usage, stop reasons, typed stream events, and an
  extension bag that preserves unknown JSON fields.
- `hofund-codec` implementations for Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Chat
  Completions, and OpenAI Responses, including SSE streaming. See
  [docs/codecs.md](docs/codecs.md).
- `hofund-quirks` profiles, `hofund-provider` adapters for Chat, Responses,
  and Messages, and `hofund-router` ordered failover before the first stream
  event.
- Local HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:3425`, TOML configuration, a bearer token
  file, SQLite usage rows, and the `serve`, `config check`, `token show`,
  `token rotate`, and `usage` commands.
- Coding-agent adapters for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode.
  `hofund agent list`, `hofund agent connect`, `hofund agent disconnect`, and
  `hofund agent status` point an agent at the local gateway. Each edit is
  backed up once, written by rename, and restored byte for byte.
- Streamed Responses `encrypted_content` is kept on the thinking part and
  written back on encode.
- Initial Cargo workspace scaffold for the hofund local LLM gateway, with
  library and binary crates, architecture checks, CI, and repository
  hygiene files.
