## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- Canonical chat IR in `hofund-ir`: messages, content parts (text, image,
  tool call, tool result, thinking), tool definitions and tool choice,
  generation parameters, usage, stop reasons, typed stream events, and an
  extension bag that preserves unknown JSON fields.
- `hofund-codec` implementations for Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Chat
  Completions, and OpenAI Responses, including SSE streaming. See
  [docs/codecs.md](docs/codecs.md).
- `hofund-quirks` profiles, `hofund-provider` adapters for Chat, Responses,
  and Messages, and `hofund-router` ordered failover before the first stream
  event.
- Local HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:3425`, TOML configuration, a bearer token
  file, SQLite usage rows, and the `serve`, `config check`, `token show`,
  `token rotate`, and `usage` commands.
- Coding-agent adapters for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode.
  `hofund agent list`, `hofund agent connect`, `hofund agent disconnect`, and
  `hofund agent status` point an agent at the local gateway. Each edit is
  backed up once, written by rename, and restored byte for byte.
- Streamed Responses `encrypted_content` is kept on the thinking part and
  written back on encode.
- `GenerativeLanguage` codec for `generateContent` and
  `streamGenerateContent`, including function calls, system instructions,
  thinking parts, thought signatures, and usage metadata. The gateway serves
  `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent`,
  `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:streamGenerateContent`, and
  `GET /v1beta/models`. Authentication accepts the bearer token,
  `x-goog-api-key`, or a `key` query value, compared in constant time.
- Menu-bar app `hofund-desktop` (Tauri v2) at `apps/desktop`. It starts and
  stops the local gateway, shows the listen address, toggles each catalog
  agent through `hofund-agent`, prints the usage table, opens the config
  file, and quits. The config path is `HOFUND_CONFIG` or
  `hofund/hofund.toml` under the platform config directory.
- Release workflow for the `hofund` CLI (cargo-dist: macOS arm64, x86_64, and
  universal; Linux x86_64 and aarch64; Windows x86_64) and for Tauri bundles.
  Archives carry SHA-256 checksums. Code signing and notarization run only
  when the repository secrets are set.
- Initial Cargo workspace scaffold for the hofund local LLM gateway, with
  library and binary crates, architecture checks, CI, and repository
  hygiene files.
